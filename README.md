# INST377-Lab

# Name (Rhyss Idham):

# Comments: Project Overview:
This project is part of Lab 4 for INST377, where we build a dynamic webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the lab is to create an interactive webpage with the following features:

Features:
Alert Me Section:

A form where users can input their name.
Upon submission, the page will display an alert saying, "Hi [Name]!" using JavaScript.

Change Color Section:

A button that toggles the background color of the page between blue and green. The page retains the color after the change.

Text Tester Section:

A form where users can enter a string.
When the "Validate Text" button is clicked, the page checks if the string contains special characters (e.g., @, #, $) and alerts the user accordingly.
Add Text Section:

A button that adds the words "Add Text" to the page title every time it is clicked.

How to Run the Project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to interact with the webpage.
Alternatively, use VSCode with the Live Server extension to serve the page and see live changes.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the webpage layout.
JavaScript: For handling interactivity and functionality.
